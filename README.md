# TriviaGame

Welcome to my simple geography trivia game. 

Answer each question before time runs out. The game should automatically proceed to the next question when
one is either answered or the clock expires. See how well you do on all the rounds of the game.

The game code is largely based on the clock and making updates to the game-state based on the current time
and whether the user made selections. The clock will visually update every second however the program actually 
checks every tenth of second whether something has changed.

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for the grid), and Vanilla JS used to make this game.
